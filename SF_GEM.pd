linexp \, mirror \, amplitude(see about smoothing \, values less than
zero \, etc) \, flip (x or y rotation) \; - set random max/min values
\; - pulsing random \, pulsing statfeed... \; - make the statfeed thing
where you choose what functions \; to be sending the outputs to...
it also uses the random max/min \, scaling them with its outputs. \;

#X text 925 240 The pulsing random will work with \; phase and rot
to basically be the disruptor from before. \; Statfeeder output: X
elements. Y functions. If I choose \; 4 functions \, assigns them evenly
\; 5 \, likewise... \; No: number of functions = number of elements.
1 to 1 \; But what would the values be? Second statfeeder.;
#X text 1309 242 Will need to make 2 or 3 \, at least \, pulser objects
\; who send the pulses to the things assigned to them \; Otherwise
can't have multiple pulses going at once because \; the input names
(spin \, xadd) will keep changing.;
